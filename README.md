Gathering Falabella item prices with web scraping for pricing strategies

Companies in the retail industry can gain an advantage over their competitors by monitoring the prices, inventory levels, and availability of their products on their e-commerce platforms.

This is possible through open-source analytical tools such as web scraping, python, proxies, and plotly. For reasons of time, the algorithm I developed was applied only to the retailer Falabella Hombres. However, it has been developed with a scalability approach, which allows it to be applied to various genres and other competitors such as Oechsle, Platanitos, MercadoLibre, Zara, and H&M.
